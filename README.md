MS_iNEXT.BetaDiv (R code and data for graphics in 2022 Manuscript by Chao et al.)

R code and data are provided for plotting all figures in the manuscript "Rarefaction and extrapolation with beta diversity under a framework of Hill numbers: the iNEXT.BetaDiv standardization". Before using the R code, you must download the package "iNEXT.3D" and "iNEXT.BetaDiv" from Anne Chao's Github. 

The data used for examples are based on (i) Spatial data: Gentry's global forest transect data (available in David Zeleny's webpage); (ii) Temporal data: beetle data for two time periods and long time series data (2005-2017) for 6 second-growth forests in Costa Rica; and (iii) Spatio-temporal data: Scotland fish species data (1985-2010).  

"MS_iNEXT.BetaDiv" includes the following files:

(1) Data Files: 

  (1a) "Data Beetles.xlsx" (for Figure 3): beetle data for two time periods (2208-2009 vs. 2010-2011).
  
  (1b) "Data Second-growth forests.xlsx" (for Figure 4): tree species data in six second-growth forests from 2005-2017.
  
  (1c) "Data Fish_Lat55-60.csv" (for Figure 5): Scotland fish data between latitude 55 and 60 from 1985-2010.

(2) "R code.R": Main code for plotting all figures (Figure 1 to 5 in the paper).

(3) "Source R code.txt": Source R code. 

(4) "Brief guide iNEXT BetaDiv.docx": introduction to iNEXT.BetaDiv and a brief guide to R code for making graphics in Chao et al. 2022 manuscript.
